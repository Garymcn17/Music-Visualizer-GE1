# Music-Visualizer-GE1

## Description
I plan on creating a music visualizer within the unity application. I want to combine shapes and colours along side music to create a visualizer in which the user feels immersed within. I have an idea which involves one central location that all the visualizations will revolve around, a central point the viewer will focus on while the surroundings begin to evolve and create amazing patterns and shapes. I plan on having a camera within the visualizer in which the user can change the angles in which they view the visualization. I do not have a definite idea of what the final product will look like but I have images in my head that I would like to create which involve shapes such as pyramids, spirals (Maybe Archimedean Spiral, Logarithmic Spiral, Helixs etc) and hopefully much more.

## Inspiration
I have looked at plenty of videos on youtube and I found that the visualizers that react to music were my favourite. I want the finished product to have a dark backdrop so the colours are more vibrant on the screen. I want the colours in the visualization to change according to the frequency and amplitude of the music. I have not worked in this area too much so I think it will be very fun to learn this as some of the visualizations people have created are incredible and they are very motivating. I will also look back on the visualizer we done in 2nd year and take some ideas from there. 

I want this visualizer to work well with all music genres and look incredible regardless of the song. However, I also want it to look different when you play different songs, so I want to implement some dynamic shapes and colours that are generated from the music.

I draw a lot of inspiration from the tetris effect game, I am a big fan of tetris and when I first seen the visualizations within this VR version of the game I was mind blown. The combination of the game, music and visualizations creates something really special and thats what I hop to achieve with my visualizer.

## Development Plan

* Learn how to work with music within Unity(Get basic visualization working) (Week 6-7)
* Experiment with the visuals and music (Week 8)
* Try to add my ideas to what we have developed and learned so far (Week 9-10)
* The project should be presentable and work well (Week 11)
* Polish of the project and get ready to submit and demo (Week 12-13)
