# Music-Visualizer-GE1

## Description
I plan on creating a music visualizer within the unity application. I want to combine shapes and colours along side music to create a visualizer in which the user feels immersed within. I have an idea which involves one central location that all the visualizations will revolve around, a central point the viewer will focus on while the surroundings begin to evolve and create amazing patterns. I plan on having a camera within the visualizer in which the user can change the angles in which they view the visualization.

## Inspiration
I have looked at plenty of videos on youtube and I found that the visualizers that react to music were my favourite. I want the finished product to have a dark backdrop so the colours are more vibrant on the screen. I want the colours in the visualization to change according to the frequency and amplitude of the music. I have not worked in this area too much so I think it will be very fun to learn this as some of the visualizations people have created are incredible and they are very motivating. I will also look back on the visualizer we done in 2nd year and take some ideas from there.
